EinsZweiDreiSechs
---

Solves the following puzzle:

       EINS
    +  ZWEI
    +  DREI
    -------
    = SECHS
    
(For those not understanding german: it means "one + two + three = six" - which is of course true.) But the above is also true if each of the letters stands for a digit (same letters mean same digit, and different letters mean different digits). 
    
The script prints all solutions and then answers the question:   
What number does 'EHI' stand for?
